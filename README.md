# Marketing-Target-Supermarket-Sales

## PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION
### BACKGROUND:
Effective marketing strategies are crucial for increasing sales in a competitive business environment. The data shows variations in purchasing behavior based on gender and geographic location, which can help address the challenges of meeting sales targets, particularly for products that are infrequently purchased.

This program aims to identify rarely purchased products, understand purchasing patterns based on gender, and analyze the distribution of purchasing locations. This information can help formulate targeted marketing strategies to boost sales of these products and achieve a 10% increase in sales revenue within 3 months.

### PROBLEM TOPIC:
Optimizing Marketing by Specifically Targeting Customers to Increase Sales Revenue

### SMART METHOD:
S - Optimize marketing by specifically targeting customers
M - Increase sales revenue by 10%
A - Analyze data on rarely purchased products, identify which customer genders rarely buy the products, and determine the correlation between products and customer types
R - Targeting specific customers can indirectly increase sales revenue
T - Plan is targeted for the next 3 months

###  PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Optimize marketing by specifically targeting customers to increase sales revenue by 10% through analyzing data on rarely purchased products, identifying which customer genders rarely buy the products, and determining the correlation between products and customer types within the next 3 months.

### QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE COVERED:
1. What are the least purchased products? (Pie chart visualization)
2. Which customer genders rarely purchase products? (Bar chart visualization)
3. What and how is the correlation between products and customer gender? (Descriptive statistics)
4. Which city has the least customers? (Pie chart visualization)
5. Which month has the least customers? (Bar chart visualization)
6. What and how is the correlation between cities and purchasing months? (Descriptive statistics)
7. Why is it necessary to focus marketing efforts on increasing revenue by 10% for rarely purchased products? (Inferential statistics)

## CONCLUSION

Based on the above data, the 'Health and beauty' product is the least purchased product. This indicates that it is either less popular or not well-promoted.

Based on gender, men tend to shop less frequently than women, suggesting that promotional efforts may be insufficiently targeted toward male potential customers.

There is no significant relationship between product type and customer gender. Thus, the promotional reach for each product can be expanded and not just directed at one gender.

Naypyitaw has the lowest purchase frequency, indicating that a different marketing approach or enhancement may be needed to increase purchase numbers.

February has the lowest purchase frequency in the last three months, suggesting that product marketing or promotion during this month was less effective.

There is a significant correlation between city and purchasing month, meaning that sales in a city are influenced by the time of the month.

By increasing marketing for rarely purchased products, the company can tap into an underutilized market potential. Increasing revenue by 10% will help improve the profitability of these products and boost the company's total revenue. If the new marketing strategies are implemented well, a significant increase in revenue is expected.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

- The 'Health and beauty' products should be promoted more frequently, especially to male customers in Naypyitaw during February. Since the purchase of product types is not strongly related to the gender of the buyer, the marketing team can introduce 'Health and beauty' products to men.
- Mandalay requires more effective promotion in February, as city sales are closely related to the month.

Implementing the new marketing strategies is expected to lead to a significant increase in revenue.
